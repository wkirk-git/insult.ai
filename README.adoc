== Overview

This is a **full-screen, dark-themed chat interface** built entirely in **vanilla JavaScript** that mimics AI behavior using **canned responses**. It is designed to feel like a real AI chat because AI is bullshit :

* Streaming text output character by character.
* Animated “thinking” indicator while the bot prepares a response.
* Non-repeating responses until all options are used.
* Fully responsive and lightweight—no libraries or frameworks required.

== Features

* Dark theme with full-screen layout.
* User messages appear on the right, bot messages on the left.
* Bot simulates typing with a streaming effect.
* Animated blinking dots for “thinking”.
* Non-repeating canned responses for more realistic conversation.
* Randomized delays to mimic AI response times.
* Fully implemented in HTML, CSS, and vanilla JavaScript.

== Installation

Simply clone or download the project folder. No dependencies are required.

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/wkirk-git/insult.ai.git
cd insult.ai
----

Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.

1. Open `index.html` in your browser.
2. Type a message in the input box at the bottom.
3. Press `Enter` or click the **Send** button.
4. Watch the bot “think” and stream its response character by character.

== Customization

You can customize the bot responses by editing the `cannedResponses` array in `script`:

[source,js]
----
let cannedResponses = [
  "Some stupid bullshit here",
  "You smell like the President's diaper.",
  "Interesting, yawn ...",
  "Want to know how to keep a moron in suspense? ............................"
];
----

You can also tweak:

* Typing speed: adjust `setTimeout` values in the `streamMessage` function.
* Thinking delay: modify the delay in the `setTimeout` inside `sendMessage()`.
* Styles: update colors, fonts, and layout in the `<style>` section.
